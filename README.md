Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix typos" and not "Fixed
typos."  This convention matches with other aspects Git commands.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
